That's it.

Additions so far:
 - Multi-line comments. `#* multi-line comment *#`
 - Import statements. `IMPORT "./path/to/library/some_library.myopl"`

## -- Original README starts below --

# py-myopl-code

All code for my "Make your own programming language in Python" tutorial series on YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZQftyCk7_SdoVexSmwy_tBgs7P0b97yD

This code is an interpreter for a BASIC-like language written in Python 3.

The latest code is in the folder which is for the latest episode (`ep14`).

I'm now finished with the development of this project, and the tutorials are complete on YouTube.

## Forks

Improvements have been made by others so I'll link to them here:
